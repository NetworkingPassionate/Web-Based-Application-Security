# üß® SQL Injection Demo ‚Äì Educational Lab Environment

This repository presents a controlled, ethical demonstration of a **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The goal is to showcase how poorly validated user input can compromise backend databases ‚Äî and more importantly, how to **detect, prevent, and mitigate** such issues in real-world environments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This demo is strictly for **educational** purposes. All testing is conducted in a local environment with non-production data. Do not use this attack on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
